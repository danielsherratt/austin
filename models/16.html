            <h2>The Austin 16 in New Zealand</h2>
            <p>The Austin 16 was well-received in New Zealand, where it found a place among both business owners and middle-class families.

It played an important role in helping to motorize New Zealand in the late 1920s and 1930s.</p>
            <p>Today, the Austin 16 remains a cherished part of New Zealand’s automotive history, particularly among vintage car enthusiasts who value its historical significance and practicality.</p>
