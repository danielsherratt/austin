            <h2>Introduction and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Austin Metro</strong> was launched in 1980 as a supermini car designed to compete with other compact cars in the rapidly growing market. The Metro was designed as a practical, efficient, and affordable urban vehicle, and it was a part of the British Leyland company’s range. It featured a small but efficient 1.0L engine and was marketed as a city car with low running costs, ideal for new drivers and families looking for an economical option.</p>

            <p>Despite being part of the same range as the iconic Mini, the Metro was aimed at a more modern audience and saw considerable success. The Metro was also sold under various badges, including Rover, during its production run, and became a staple on British roads. It was eventually replaced by the Rover 100 series in 1997.</p>
