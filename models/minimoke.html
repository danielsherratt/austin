            <h2>Introduction and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Mini Moke</strong> was introduced in 1964 as a small, lightweight, open-top vehicle based on the iconic Mini. Originally designed as a military vehicle, it was intended for use by the British Army, but its unique design and affordability led to its production for civilian markets. The Moke quickly became popular for recreational use, particularly in warm climates, due to its fun, utilitarian nature.</p>

            <p>Produced in both the UK and Australia, the Moke became an international icon, known for its distinctive look and versatility. It was used for a wide variety of purposes, including beach transportation, military, and commercial use. Despite its initial commercial struggles, the Moke found success as a beach buggy and remained in production until 1981.</p>
