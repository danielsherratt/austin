            <h2>Introduction and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Austin A40 / A50 Cambridge</strong> was introduced in 1954 as a mid-range family saloon car. The A40 and A50 models were part of Austin's efforts to meet the demand for affordable, practical vehicles for the post-war British market. The A40 was slightly smaller and less powerful than the A50, which offered improved performance and more luxury features. Together, these models helped establish Austin as a key player in the mid-market segment in the UK and abroad, particularly in markets like New Zealand.</p>

            <p>These vehicles were marketed to customers looking for a reliable and affordable family car with modern features. The A40 and A50 Cambridge enjoyed wide popularity and continued to be produced through the 1950s, contributing to Austin’s strong post-war recovery.</p>
