            <h2>Introduction and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Austin 18/24</strong>, introduced in 1907, was a major milestone for the Austin Motor Company as it marked the company's move into the higher-end car market. Aimed at middle-class consumers, it was an affordable yet more powerful alternative to other cars in its range. The 18/24 was produced during a time when there was increasing demand for reliable and durable cars for both private and commercial purposes.</p>

            <p>Herbert Austin's vision for the Austin 18/24 was to create a well-balanced vehicle that offered luxury features without the prohibitively high cost. The car’s engine was one of the strongest in its class at the time, and it was designed to provide a smooth driving experience while maintaining affordability for the growing middle class in the UK and abroad, including in New Zealand.</p>
