            <h2>Introduction and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Austin Marina</strong> was introduced in 1971 as a family car, designed to compete with other popular mid-size vehicles of the time. Built by British Leyland, the Marina was developed as a modern, versatile car to replace the aging Morris Oxford and other similar models. It was marketed as an affordable car that offered practicality, reliability, and an enjoyable driving experience.</p>

            <p>The Marina’s design was influenced by contemporary British and European styling trends, and it was available in a variety of body styles, including 2-door and 4-door saloons, as well as a station wagon. Despite its good looks and competitive pricing, the Marina’s reputation suffered from reliability issues and poor build quality, limiting its long-term success. However, it still remained a popular choice for families during the 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
