            <h2>Introduction and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Austin Freeway</strong> was introduced in 1961 as a larger family car aimed at competing with other mid-size sedans on the market. It was one of Austin’s first forays into the upper-middle class car market, designed to provide more power, space, and comfort than the smaller Austin models. The Freeway was available in both 4-door and 2-door versions, appealing to families and business owners alike.</p>

            <p>The car was produced for a relatively short period, from 1961 to 1966, but it played a key role in Austin’s range during the 1960s, offering more luxurious options compared to the smaller A40 and A50 models. The Freeway was exported to various countries, including New Zealand, where it was appreciated for its practicality and reasonable price for the size and luxury it offered.</p>
