            <h2>Introduction and Historical Significance</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Austin Montego</strong> was introduced in 1984 as a larger family car, designed to offer more space, comfort, and features than the smaller models in the British Leyland range, like the Austin Metro. The Montego was marketed as an affordable yet stylish family car that could compete with mid-range sedans from other manufacturers. It was produced during a period of transition for British Leyland, later known as the Rover Group, and featured modern styling and a focus on practicality.</p>

            <p>The Montego was well-received for its comfortable ride and versatility. However, its reputation was hampered by issues with build quality, and it never quite matched the success of its rivals. Production continued until 1994, but it was eventually replaced by the Rover 400 series.</p>
