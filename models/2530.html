<h2>History</h2>
The 25/30 hp was Austin's first production car, introduced shortly after the company was founded in 1905. It featured a 4-cylinder engine and was aimed at the higher end of the market, reflecting early motoring’s association with the wealthy elite. The engine was a 5.2-litre side-valve unit capable of around 30 horsepower. Only a small number were produced at the original Longbridge plant. Although not a commercial success due to its high price and the economic limitations of the time, the 25/30 laid the groundwork for Austin’s later ventures into smaller, mass-market vehicles.
While not common in New Zealand, it’s possible a few were privately imported, though today it’s mostly of historical interest to collectors.
